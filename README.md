How to Play:
The program will ask the user to enter a number to set as the target.
Another user will guess numbers until they find the correct one.
The game will provide hints to guide the guessing process.
The game exits when the correct number is guessed or if the user types "exit".

2. Rock Paper Scissors Game
A text-based rock-paper-scissors game where the user plays against the computer.

Features:
