# CSF Assignment 1

## Assignment Overview
This assignment consists of two Python programs:
1. **Guess Number Game** - A simple game where a player sets a number, and another player attempts to guess it.
2. **Utility Functions Program** - A collection of useful functions, including prime number calculations, unit conversions, consonant counting, min/max finding, palindrome checking, and word counting from a file.

## 1. Guess Number Game
### Description
This game allows one player to set a number (between 1 and 100), and another player attempts to guess it. The program provides feedback on whether the guessed number is too high or too low. Players can also exit the game anytime by typing "exit."

### How to Run
1. Run the `TsheringChoden_02240274_A1_PB.py` file.
2. Enter a number between 1 and 100 to set the secret number.
3. Another player tries to guess the number.
4. The game provides hints until the correct number is guessed.
5. Players can exit by typing "exit."

### Features
- User-defined number selection.
- Provides hints (higher/lower) for guessing.
- Exit option available anytime.

## 2. Utility Functions Program
### Description
This program provides multiple functionalities, accessible via a menu-based system. The available functions include:
1. **Prime Number Sum** - Calculates the sum of prime numbers in a given range.
2. **Length Unit Converter** - Converts between meters and feet.
3. **Consonant Counter** - Counts the number of consonants in a given string.
4. **Min & Max Finder** - Finds the smallest and largest number in a user-provided list.
5. **Palindrome Checker** - Checks if a given string is a palindrome.
6. **Word Counter** - Counts occurrences of specific words ("the", "was", "and") in a text file.

### How to Run
1. Run the `TsheringChoden_02240274_A1_PA.py` file.
2. Select a function from the menu.
3. Provide the required inputs.
4. View the calculated results.
5. Exit the program anytime by selecting option `0`.

### Features
- Menu-based selection.
- Multiple utility functions for various calculations.
- Handles errors and invalid inputs gracefully.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- A text file for the word counter function (if using option 6 in the Utility Functions Program).

## How to Execute the Programs
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the folder containing the Python files.
3. Run the desired Python file:
    - `TsheringChoden_02240274_A1_PA.py` for the Utility Functions Program.
    - `TsheringChoden_02240274_A1_PB.py` for the Guess Number Game.
